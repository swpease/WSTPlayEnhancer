# WSTPlayEnhancer
Enhanced video features for the WST Play service

# About
I added some functionality to the WST Play streaming service that I think make for a better experience. 
This is an addon available on the [Firefox addons site](https://addons.mozilla.org/) and the [Chrome webstore](https://chromewebstore.google.com/search/WST%20Play%20Enhancer).


# Features
1. Has a "spoiler-free" mode that removes duration information
2. Stores where you left off watching non-live videos
3. Keyboard actions on videos:
    - spacebar to pause/play
        - may need to click on video first
    - left/right arrows to go back/fwd 10 seconds
    - hold shift + L/R to go back/fwd 5 minutes

# Reviews
"Excellent add-on."

"Works really well!"

"I fucking love it!"

"Watching both live and on-demand videos on WST Play is now made so-so much better."
